# The Lazy's Favorite Trainer
As someone who has always played Bully with a mouse and keyboard, the idea for this mod came from a simple inconvenience "Having to move my right hand to the arrow keys just to navigate menus". I wonder, why bother using the arrow keys when my mouse is already there, doing nothing? That's what led me to the concept of pointer-based navigation.


It's functionally similar to arrow-key navigation in that you still can't rotate the camera. With arrow-key navigation, your right hand is busy pressing keys. With pointer-based navigation, camera control is disabled while the menu is open. Still, this approach makes the experience feel more intuitive and natural, especially for mouse users.


Thankfully with the help of GetScreenCoords, a function provided by derpy54320, this idea became feasible. It allows us to determine an object's position on screen, making it possible to implement a 2D pointer that can interact with bounding boxes.
